# When preparing for a front-end developer interview, it's important to be ready for non-technical questions as well. These questions help showcase your soft skills, professional attitude, and adaptability. Here are some common non-technical questions and tips on how to prepare for them.

## Q & A

**Tell me about yourself.**

- I am Yosef Yuan, a dedicated front-end engineer with over 7 years of experience, skilled in JavaScript, React, Vue, TypeScript, Node.js, etc. I am proficient in performance optimization, consistently enhancing application speed and user experience. Additionally, I am a curious problem solver with a strong ability to troubleshoot issues efficiently, particularly through exception monitoring systems. In my previous role, I led the front-end development for a major H5 application in the growth department, significantly improving user engagement from 500,000 to over a million users. I also led several core technical projects, including performance monitoring, offline pre-rendering, and tool upgrades for millions of users, resulting in a significant performance boost and a 30% increase in AD effectiveness.

**Why did you choose front-end development?**

- "I chose front-end development because I love the combination of creativity and technical skills it requires. I enjoy designing and implementing user interfaces that provide an excellent user experience. Seeing users interact with the interfaces I've built and knowing I've contributed to making their experience better is incredibly rewarding."

**What is your greatest professional achievement?**

- Regarding this, I want to mention two points: the offline pre-rendering project and the DeepLink tool upgrade.
  - **Offline pre-rendering**: This project is a follow-up to the previous performance monitoring project. Its goal is to improve the First Meaningful Paint (FMP) time of H5 pages. Due to historical and technical limitations, we couldn't fully upgrade to server-side rendering. After technical research and solution testing discussions, we adopted a new solution: without changing the original technology, we added a service module that improved page rendering speed from the original 2 seconds to less than 1 second. Of course, the rendering speed monitoring system, which I led the development of, was integrated into all core front-end pages to visualize their performance.
  - **DeepLink Tool upgrade**: The company's original DeepLink tool had defects, but due to historical reasons and a huge user base—about a million DAU—upgrading was difficult. However, without an upgrade, ad effectiveness would be significantly affected. Therefore, we decided to minimize surface changes but thoroughly upgrade the core technology with a "replace the core, not the shell" approach. Along with immediate monitoring and phased upgrades, we achieved a smooth technical upgrade within a month. This optimized the tool thoroughly and increased the success rate from less than 40% to about 70%, directly reaching around 300,000 more users daily.

**How do you handle stress or tight deadlines?**

- "I handle stress by breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable parts and prioritizing them. I use tools like Todo List, Pomodoro and Google Calender to split the big task into small one and ensure I'm meeting deadlines. Additionally, I communicate regularly with my team to make sure we're all aligned and can support each other if needed. This approach has helped me stay focused and productive under pressure."

**What are your top three soft skills?** TODO

- "My top three soft skills are teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. In my last project, I worked closely with a team of developers and designers to deliver a complex web application. My ability to clearly communicate ideas and listen to feedback ensured smooth collaboration. When we encountered technical challenges, my problem-solving skills helped us find effective solutions quickly."

**What are your thoughts on teamwork?** TODO

- "I believe teamwork is essential for the success of any project. Collaboration brings diverse perspectives and skills, which leads to more innovative solutions. In my previous roles, I’ve always made an effort to foster a collaborative environment by encouraging open communication, respecting different viewpoints, and being willing to help others."

**How do you keep your skills current?**

- This involves two parts: in-depth learning and updating existing technologies, and expanding knowledge of cutting-edge technologies.
  1. **In-depth learning and updating existing technologies**: I regularly browse technical blogs, review open-source code, and create small demos. Sometimes, I directly implement these in online projects.
  2. **Expanding knowledge of cutting-edge technologies**: Through blogs and communities, I learn about cutting-edge technologies that may not be directly relevant to my work. I then take technical courses and create demo projects to deepen my understanding and mastery of these technologies.

**What challenges have you faced in past projects, and how did you solve them?**

- In one project, the boss only provided his idea with no ready-made solution but a clear deadline. Initially, I didn't know how to start. After preliminary technical research, I decided to implement the simplest solution by the deadline. Later, I found a better approach and optimized it.

**Why do you want to join our company?**

- I really like the company's philosophy: using AI to directly support enterprise-level services, achieving system integration and data flow enhancement, thereby improving efficiency. I believe this will have a significant market in the future.

**What are your career plans for the future?**

- In the future, I hope to continue deepening my expertise in the front-end field, focusing on front-end engineering and performance optimization. In the long run, I aspire to become a front-end architect and technical expert, positively influencing my team members and helping my team thrive through my passion and dedication.
