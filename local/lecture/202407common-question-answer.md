When preparing for a front-end developer interview, it's important to be ready for non-technical questions as well. These questions help showcase your soft skills, professional attitude, and adaptability. Here are some common non-technical questions and tips on how to prepare for them

## Q & A

1. **Tell me about yourself.**
   - "I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and have been working as a front-end developer for the past three years. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Angular. I'm passionate about creating intuitive and responsive user interfaces. 

   - I am Yosef Yuan, a dedicated front-end engineer with over 7 years of experience, skilled in JavaScript, React, Vue, TypeScript, Node.js, etc. I am proficient in performance optimization, consistently enhancing application speed and user experience. Additionally, I am a curious problem solver with a strong ability to troubleshoot issues efficiently, particularly through exception monitoring systems.
   In my previous role, I led the front-end development for a major H5 application at the growth department, which significantly improved user engagement from 10 万级别到百万级别. 另外， 也领导了包括性能监控、离线预渲染、百万级用户的唤端工具升级等多个核心技术项目，使页面的性能有了巨大的提升，使广告的拉新效果直接提升了约30%。

2. **Why did you choose front-end development?**
   - "I chose front-end development because I love the combination of creativity and technical skills it requires. I enjoy designing and implementing user interfaces that provide an excellent user experience. Seeing users interact with the interfaces I've built and knowing I've contributed to making their experience better is incredibly rewarding."

3. **What is your greatest professional achievement?**
   - "My greatest professional achievement was leading a project to redesign the user interface of our company's main product. The new design improved the user experience and increased user retention by 20%. This project required close collaboration with designers, back-end developers, and stakeholders to ensure that we met our goals and deadlines."

   - 关于这点， 我想说2个点，离线预渲染项目和唤端工具升级改造

    - 离线预渲染：This project is a follow-up to the previous performance monitoring project. Its goal is to improve the First Meaningful Paint (FMP) time of H5 pages.
    由于历史原因和技术能力限制，我们无法做到完全升级为服务端渲染。经过技术调研和方案测试讨论，我们采用了一种全新的技术方案： 不需要改动原有技术，通过增加一个服务模块，实现了页面渲染速度由原来的2s提升为不足1s。 当然，说到渲染速度的监控系统，也是由我领导开发的，并接入了所有的前端核心页面，实现其性能的可视化。

    - 唤端工具升级：公司原有唤端工具有缺陷，但因为历史原因和用户量巨大-约有百万dau，导致升级困难，但若不升级，会导致广告效果受到明显的影响。基于此，我们决定，尽量减少表面改动，但对核心技术进行彻底改造的技术方案： 即“换芯不换壳”， 加上即时的监控和灰度升级，实现技术方案的平缓升级。在1个月时间里，终于实现了技术方案的彻底优化，并使原有的唤端的成功率由不足40%升级为约70%， 直接增加了每日约60w左右的用户触达。

4. **How do you handle stress or tight deadlines?**
   - "I handle stress by breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable parts and prioritizing them. I use tools like Todo List and Tomoto  to keep track of my progress and ensure I'm meeting deadlines. Additionally, I communicate regularly with my team to make sure we're all aligned and can support each other if needed. This approach has helped me stay focused and productive under pressure."

5. **What are your top three soft skills?**
   - "My top three soft skills are teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. In my last project, I worked closely with a team of developers and designers to deliver a complex web application. My ability to clearly communicate ideas and listen to feedback ensured smooth collaboration. When we encountered technical challenges, my problem-solving skills helped us find effective solutions quickly."

6. **What are your thoughts on teamwork?**
   - "I believe teamwork is essential for the success of any project. Collaboration brings diverse perspectives and skills, which leads to more innovative solutions. In my previous roles, I’ve always made an effort to foster a collaborative environment by encouraging open communication, respecting different viewpoints, and being willing to help others."

7. **How do you keep your skills current?**
   - "I stay updated with the latest technologies and trends by following industry blogs, attending webinars, and participating in online courses. I’m also active in several developer communities, where I can share knowledge and learn from others. Recently, I completed a course on advanced React techniques, which has already improved my development efficiency."

   - 主要分2块： 现有技术的深入学习和更新，其他前沿技术的扩展。
   1. 现有技术的深入学习和更新： 平时逛技术类的博客，自我实现一些小的demo，有时也会根据情况在线上项目中直接落地。
   2. 其他前沿技术的扩展： 通过博客和社区等，了解到一些前沿的技术，自己的工作中其实也不会涉及到;这是会通过参加一下技术课程并自己写一些demo项目等实现对的技术升入理解和掌握。

8. **What challenges have you faced in past projects, and how did you solve them?**
   - "In one project, we faced a challenge with browser compatibility issues that affected our web app's performance. I conducted thorough testing to identify the specific issues and then implemented polyfills and fallback solutions to ensure a consistent user experience across all browsers. This required meticulous attention to detail and close collaboration with the QA team."

   - 其中的一个项目，老板仅仅是提供了他的想法，至于如何实现，并无现成方案，但却有明确的时间节点。开始时，并不知道如何下手。经过初步的几个技术调研，决定先采用最简单的技术方案，并在截止日期前先实现了它。再后来，我们发现了更好的方法，在此基础上， 进行了优化。

9. **Why do you want to join our company?**
   - "I am impressed by your company's commitment to innovation and the quality of your products. Your focus on user experience aligns with my own values as a front-end developer. I’m excited about the opportunity to work with a talented team and contribute to projects that make a real impact. I believe my skills and experience will be a valuable addition to your team."

   - 我很喜欢我们公司的理念： 即通过AI直接助力于企业级的服务，实现其系统的串联和数据流的整合，实现了效率的提升。我认为这在未来也会有很大的市场。

10. **What are your career plans for the future?**
    - "In the future, I aim to further develop my skills as a front-end developer and take on more leadership responsibilities. I’m particularly interested in areas like UX design and performance optimization. Long-term, I aspire to become a lead developer or a front-end architect, where I can mentor junior developers and help shape the technical direction of projects."

    - 未来，我希望在前端领域继续深耕，关于前端的工程化和性能优化，会是我继续努力的方向。长远来看，我希望我可以成为一名前端架构师和技术专家， 并通过我的积极和热心， 影响我身边的开发成员，更好的帮助我的团队。
